      + removed .github/workflows/test.yaml file
      + added .github/workflows/*.yml files, one for each OS:
          linux, macos, windows
      + added docs directory
      + converted old README.md to rakudoc format in docs/README.rakudoc
      + added dist.ini file with settings to rebuild
          the README.md with cmd: mi6 build; automatic with cmd: mi6 release
    - Changed all .p6 to .raku, perl6 to raku, .pm6 to .rakumod, and
          .pod6 to .rakudoc
    - Tweaked docs
      + added note on retaining original name but modernizing internals
      + removed the example with the HEREDOC (<<EOP) which doesn't seem to 
          work
      + added missing description of sub load-pod
    - Added new test 4
      + ensure =begin/=end rakudoc works like =begin/=end pod
        This module can load such pod okay, but Raku cannot yet handle it.

        handle =begin/=end rakudoc delimeters.
    - Removed test dependency on Test::META

	* lib/X/Pod/Load/SourceErrors.rakumod: For new version, exceptions 
          extracted and taken out.

2021-11-28  jmerelo  <jmerelo@princess-carolyn>

	* lib/Pod/Load.pm6 (Pod): Adds pod-load to address what was actually 
          a bug in the documentation (but is actually doable). Thanks to Tom 
          Browder @tbrowder for the bug report.

2019-06-24  JJMerelo  <jmerelo@bojack>

	* META6.json: Fixes a problem when =output was in the middle of a sentence 
          and not at the beginning of a line.

2019-06-11  Juan J. merelo  <jmerelo@penny>

	* lib/Pod/Load.pm6: This is mainly a maintenance version to avoid problems 
          with CPAN.

2019-06-10  Juan J. merelo  <jmerelo@penny>

	* lib/Pod/Load.pm6 (Pod): Fixed error found by Antonio GÃ¡miz

2019-04-13  Juan J. merelo  <jmerelo@penny>

	* lib/Pod/Load.pm6 (Pod): Fixes error with loading scripts; use v6 failed 
          and besides the output at the end clashed with the module enclosure we use.

2019-03-24  Juan J. merelo  <jmerelo@penny>

	* lib/Pod/Load.pm6 (Pod): This needed to put evaluation in a module just in 
          case there's something in the namespace that could be repeated. Using a 
          module with random name hides the variables, does not affect the POD.

2018-12-18  Juan J. merelo  <jmerelo@penny>

	* META6.json: Bumps up with examples and improving documentation.
	  nqp is not actually a dependency you can list...

2018-12-17  Juan J. merelo  <jmerelo@penny>

	* lib/Pod/Load.pm6 (Pod): Adds some more dependencies, and basically gets 
          it ready for deployment in github. Thanks to Ashe Connor (@kivikakk) for 
          the bug reports.
	  (Pod): Changes to return an array of all the pods available, not just the 
          first one.

2018-12-15  Juan J. merelo  <jmerelo@penny>

	* lib/Pod/Load.pm6 (Pod): Adds the multi back, and also adds a way to 
          reconfigure the precomp store. Might be better, though.

2018-12-14  Juan J. merelo  <jmerelo@penny>

	* lib/Pod/Load.pm6 (Pod): Eliminates one multi to avoid confusion with Str. 
          Leaves just the one.

    - Initial version # unknown date
